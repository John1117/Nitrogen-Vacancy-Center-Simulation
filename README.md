# Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Simulation

This project simulates the behavior of the nitrogen-vacancy center (NVC) in a nano-diamond. By considering the tetrahedral micro-structure of the nano-diamond, we accounted for four possible orientations of the NVCâ€™s quantization axis. This property is used to accurately simulate Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) and Optically Detected Relaxation Spectroscopy (ODRS). Additionally, the ODRS exhibits a stretched exponential decay curve, which I found it to be the sum of multiple exponential decays with different decay rates.

## Features

- **NVC distribution Simulation**: Considers the tetrahedral structure of nano-diamonds and Gaussian-like distribution.
- **ODMR Simulation**: Accurate simulation of optically detected magnetic resonance with or without degeneracies.
- **ODRS Simulation**: Simulation of optically detected relaxation spectroscopy, which behaves as a stretched exponential decay.
- **Decay Curve Decomposition**: The stretched exponential decay is demonstrated to be the sum of several distinct exponential decays.
